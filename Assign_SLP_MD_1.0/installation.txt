
Assign_SLP_MD package


There is no installation required because these Matlab programs 
are not compiled.

The example st6Gal1 work is included in the package.  These are 
in a different directory than the source of the files.  The directories 
used in the bash script have to be changed to example_st6Gal1 .  
The output is included, except for the Matlab .mat data file.  

The path to Matlab programs include /src .  This has to be changed 
in the bash script.

A 1000ns trajectory was used to generate all of the calculations - 

noe vectors
chemical shifts
coordinates and order parameters

The package MD2NOE_Protein package includes the same calculations 
which are used in the example.  MD2NOE_Protein was used to make all 
of these predictions.
